#Vimvironment

This is my terminal configuration, including zsh and vim.

#TODO

* if it's OS X, install brew if necessary.
* install YCM with C and Go completer(./install.sh --clang-completer --gocode-completer).
* check if components are already installed.
* check if dotfiles already exists, if do, archive them instead of delete.
